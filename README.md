# 🌩️ Dykat — Cloud Security Architect Portfolio

## ✨ Overview

This is my personal portfolio website where I document my learning path in cybersecurity, cloud security, and systems programming. The site features a moody noir palette (Vampire Black, Charade, Wine Red) with refined contrast, subtle motion, and a focus on readability.

## 🎯 Purpose

- **Portfolio**: Showcase my skills, projects, and learning focus areas
- **Daily Logs**: Document my learning progress and insights
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Share technical experiences and travel reflections
- **Professional Presence**: Establish a digital identity in the cybersecurity space

## 🚀 Features

### Design & UX
- **Noir Gothic Palette**: Dark, moody layout using Vampire Black / Charade for serious UI, with Wine Red CTAs and Pink Lavender accents.
- **Refined Motion**: Subtle, purposeful animation for clarity and rhythm (fade, lift, focus states)
- **Responsive Design**: Fully mobile-optimized with breakpoints for tablets and phones
- **Solid Surfaces**: Dark, grounded surface panels for better contrast and a serious tone
- **Subtle Texture**: Minimal texture and depth (no noisy overlays) for readability
